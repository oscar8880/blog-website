# Blog Website
### A core HTML and CSS Project

For this project I created a static website for displaying blog posts.

Go to https://oscar8880.github.io/blog-website/ to view the site.

The key learning points were:
* Using core HTML features to build web layouts
* Using core CSS features to style web components
* Creating responsive web layouts with CSS Grid, Flexbox and media queries
* Creating a design system
